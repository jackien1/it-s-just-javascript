# It's Just JavaScript :telescope:

> An introduction into the fundamentals of Javascript.

`It's Just JavaScript` focuses on educating students on the language of the web, JavaScript. Over the course of an entire week, you will learn the basics of JavaScript and develop simple web applications. Don’t worry if you don’t know programming, as the title suggests, “It’s Just JavaScript!”

This repository contains our lesson plan, in-class presentations, and resources for further exploration into JavaScript. As we only meet for 2 hours for each class, you should really consider researching material outside of class. Use this repository as a starting point for your research; take a look at the different websites, books, and online classes. The possibilities of JavaScript are endless! Try building apps using _React Native_, websites with _React_, or servers with _Node.js_.

Now let's just jump right into it! :balloon:
